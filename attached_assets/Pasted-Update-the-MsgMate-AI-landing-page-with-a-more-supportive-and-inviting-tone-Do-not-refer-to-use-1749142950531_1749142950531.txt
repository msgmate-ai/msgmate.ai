Update the MsgMate.AI landing page with a more supportive and inviting tone. Do **not** refer to users as “emotionally aware daters.” Instead, highlight how MsgMate helps people *say it better with confidence, authenticity, and charm*. Use the phrase “Your personal AI Wingmate” as a friendly framing device throughout.

**Key sections to revise and include:**

1. **Headline & CTA Section**
   - Keep the current logo and tagline.
   - Replace any reference to "emotionally aware" with:
     > “Helping you say it better – with confidence, charm, and authenticity.”
   - Emphasise:
     > “Limited Free Testing Subscriptions Available” with a warm, inviting call-to-action to join the beta.

2. **Tool Highlights Section**
   - Don’t refer to “two tools.” Instead say:
     > “Explore our message helper features – perfect for any stage of the conversation.”
   - Use iPhone screenshots provided by the user (not mockups) to show both:
     - “Say It Better” (user writes a message, gets 3 refined options).
     - “Help Me Craft a Message” (user receives a message, chooses tone, gets 3 replies).

3. **Tone Section**
   - Title: “Express Yourself in Any Tone”
   - Text: “Free beta includes access to our core tones – perfect for every type of dating conversation.”
   - Display tone cards: Playful, Curious, Confident, and Charming.

4. **“Perfect for Thoughtful Daters” Section**
   - Keep the existing visuals and structure. 
   - Bullet points:
     - “Value Connection – You care about meaningful conversations and real connection.”
     - “Want to Stay Authentic – You want help expressing yourself better, without sounding fake or robotic.”
     - “Overthink Messages – You often know what you want to say, but struggle with how to phrase it just right.”

5. **Final Call to Action**
   - Heading: “Ready to Transform Your Dating Conversations?”
   - Invite users again to join the free beta with:
     > “Be part of our early access group and help shape the future of confident, enjoyable dating conversations.”

**Important Notes:**
- Use the **user-supplied iPhone screenshots** to show actual app features.
- Match the tone of all text to be encouraging, warm, and confidence-building.
- Do not replace the current main app or home screen. This is a **standalone promotional landing page** designed to collect waiting list emails.
