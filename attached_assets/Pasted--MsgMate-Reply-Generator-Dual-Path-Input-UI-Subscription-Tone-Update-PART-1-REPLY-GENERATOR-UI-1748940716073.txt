✅ MsgMate Reply Generator: Dual-Path Input UI + Subscription Tone Update

PART 1: REPLY GENERATOR UI CHANGES

OBJECTIVE:
Update the reply generator UI to support two input modes — "Say It Better" and "Help Me Craft a Message" — with grouped tone selection by dating stage and subscription tier.

FILES TO EDIT:
client/src/components/ReplyGenerator.tsx

STEP-BY-STEP:

1. Add Mode Selector
Above the message input, add:
• Say It Better – "You’ve got the idea, we’ll help you express it."
• Help Me Craft a Message – "Not sure what to say? Let’s write it together."

2. Conditional Input Display
If mode is "say-it-better":
• Show: “What would you like to say?” (free-text input)
• Hide: tone selector (greyed out with tooltip: “Not used in this mode”)

If mode is "help-me-craft":
• Show: tone selector grouped by dating stage
• Hide: free-text input

3. Replace Tone Dropdown with Grouped Selector
Use this structure:

const toneGroups = [
  {
    label: "💌 First Message",
    tier: "free",
    tones: [
      { name: "Playful", emoji: "😊", intent: "Break the ice with charm and fun." },
      { name: "Curious", emoji: "🤔", intent: "Spark interest with a thoughtful tone." },
      { name: "Confident", emoji: "💪", intent: "Start strong and self-assured." },
      { name: "Charming", emoji: "✨", intent: "Leave a memorable first impression." },
    ],
  },
  {
    label: "💬 Getting to Know Each Other",
    tier: "basic",
    tones: [
      { name: "Flirty", emoji: "😘", intent: "Keep things cheeky and light-hearted." },
      { name: "Authentic", emoji: "💯", intent: "Show your true self, no filters." },
      { name: "Witty", emoji: "😏", intent: "Make them laugh and think." },
      { name: "Supportive", emoji: "🤗", intent: "Offer kindness and care." },
    ],
  },
  {
    label: "💞 Going Deeper",
    tier: "pro",
    tones: [
      { name: "Romantic", emoji: "❤️", intent: "Let your feelings show." },
      { name: "Sincere", emoji: "🙏", intent: "Be honest and open." },
      { name: "Assertive", emoji: "👊", intent: "Speak your truth boldly." },
      { name: "Mysterious", emoji: "🔮", intent: "Keep them intrigued." },
    ],
  },
  {
    label: "🧘 Keeping It Light",
    tier: "elite",
    comingSoon: true,
    tones: [
      { name: "Casual", emoji: "✌️", intent: "Keep it breezy and easy-going." },
      { name: "Supportive", emoji: "🤗", intent: "Show up as their cheerleader." },
      { name: "Authentic", emoji: "💯", intent: "Keep things real and relaxed." },
    ],
  },
];

4. Lock Inaccessible Tone Groups
• Use lock icons and tooltips if user’s tier is below the group’s level.
• Show “Coming Soon” on Elite tone group (greyed out).

5. Button Logic (No Change in Label)
[ Generate Replies → ]
• Say It Better = enhances user’s input message
• Help Me Craft = uses tone + message received to return 2–3 replies

6. Update Tool Header:
Replace old title with:
🧠 **Find the Right Words**
