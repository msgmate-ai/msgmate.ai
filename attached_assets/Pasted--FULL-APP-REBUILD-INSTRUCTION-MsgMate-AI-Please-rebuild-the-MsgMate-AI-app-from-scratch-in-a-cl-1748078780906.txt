📌 FULL APP REBUILD INSTRUCTION — MsgMate.AI

Please rebuild the MsgMate.AI app from scratch in a clean Replit project with all features listed below. This is a complete reset — all code must be clean, stable, and professionally structured. No legacy bugs or memory issues should be carried over.

✅ CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
1. **Reply Generator (Free)**  
   - Users input a message they received and choose a tone  
   - Optionally, users can add a rough idea of what they want to say (intent box)  
   - The app generates 3 suggested replies  
   - Replies appear directly underneath the generator  
   - Include a loading spinner during generation

2. **Tones by Tier:**  
   - Free = 5 tones  
   - Basic+ = 10 tones  
   - Pro = 15 tones  
   - Tone list can be placed in a dropdown grouped by tier  
   - If a user selects a locked tone, show a small message suggesting upgrade

3. **Conversation Starters (Basic+ Tier)**  
   - Allow user to input interests and profile context  
   - Button to generate conversation starters  
   - Output below the form  
   - Only visible to logged-in Basic+ or Pro users

4. **Message Coach (Pro Tier)**  
   - Lets the user paste their drafted reply and get inline feedback  
   - Provide analysis: tone, clarity, emotional impact  
   - Clearly marked as a Pro feature

5. **Message Decoder (Pro Tier)**  
   - NEW tool replacing Conversation Memory  
   - User pastes a received message  
   - Tool explains: possible intent, tone, subtext, and how to interpret it  
   - Clearly marked as a Pro feature

✅ SUBSCRIPTION & AUTH
6. **User Login System**  
   - Required for subscriptions  
   - Simple email + password (no OAuth required)  
   - Login and Sign Up pages required  
   - Session persistence

7. **Subscription System**  
   - Stripe-powered (test keys for now)  
   - Tier access gates:
     - Free: 10 replies total, 5 tones
     - Basic+ (£4.99/mo): 100 messages/month, 10 tones, unlocks Conversation Starters
     - Pro (£9.99/mo): 400 messages/month, 15 tones, unlocks Message Coach + Message Decoder  
   - Elite tier placeholder: “Coming Soon”
   - Subscription page showing benefits per tier and upgrade/downgrade options  
   - Prevent use of locked features or tones without active plan

✅ BRANDING, UI & COLORS
8. **Brand Identity**
   - Name: MsgMate.AI  
   - Tagline: “Your personal AI Wingmate”  
   - Logo: Speech bubble with red heart (use placeholder)  
   - Font: Clean, modern sans-serif  
   - Colors: Dark blue primary (#001E3C), greys for secondary sections (#F3F4F6, #6B7280), white background, buttons in brand dark blue

9. **Layout & UX**
   - Place reply generator at the top of homepage  
   - Place additional tools underneath it  
   - Clear headings: “Get help with your reply”, “Additional Tools”  
   - Show/hide tools based on subscription status  
   - Place a fixed login & subscription nav bar at the top of the site

✅ DEPLOYMENT
10. **Domain & Deployment**
   - Link to existing domain: www.msgmate.ai  
   - Use Replit’s custom domain integration  
   - Ensure SendGrid email config remains functional  
   - Ensure the app works reliably on both desktop and mobile

📦 Final Deliverables
- Fully working web app with all features above
- No legacy issues (especially Conversation Memory bugs)
- Fully commented code with clean structure
- All tier restrictions tested

Once complete, I’ll manually test the app and verify functionality across features. Thank you!
