// TASK: Improve Say It Better mode by making the enhanced replies more context-aware and emotionally aligned with the original message.

// GOAL:
Refactor the prompt logic so that the AI returns three helpful rewrites that vary in style â€” but are influenced by the original messageâ€™s emotional tone and intensity.

â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“

ðŸŽ¯ WHAT TO DO:

1. Use the user's original message (`userInput`) to infer tone and emotional intensity.
   - This can be done via basic NLP or prompt chaining inside the system message.
   - Suggested emotional tones to detect: Friendly, Playful, Sincere, Flirty, Casual, Romantic, Awkward, Boring, Confident.

2. Adjust the 3 enhanced reply styles dynamically based on that detected tone. Use this model:

   - âœ… **Option 1 â€“ Polished**  
     - Clean up grammar, improve clarity and flow.  
     - Stay faithful to original messageâ€™s tone and structure.
     - Always safe to include.

   - âœ… **Option 2 â€“ Confident Twist**  
     - Make slightly bolder, clearer, or more emotionally direct.  
     - Style depends on message tone: If awkward â†’ smoother. If flirty â†’ more composed.

   - âœ… **Option 3 â€“ Playful or Fresh**  
     - Only add light playfulness, humor, or charm **if the original message invites it**.
     - Otherwise, offer a creative spin that stays in line with the original vibe (e.g. vulnerable â†’ make it more emotionally open, not jokey).

3. Prompt Instruction to Model:

```text
You are helping someone improve a message they want to send in a dating conversation.

Hereâ€™s the original message:
"[userInput]"

First, quickly assess the tone and energy level of the message. Then, rewrite it with more clarity, confidence, and natural emotional flow â€” while offering 3 distinct versions that reflect different useful directions.

ðŸŸ¦ Option 1: Clean and Polished  
Improve grammar and flow, while preserving the tone, intention, and vibe.

ðŸŸ¨ Option 2: Confident and Composed  
Make it slightly more direct, self-assured, or emotionally clear â€” but keep it appropriate to the original energy level.

ðŸŸª Option 3: Playful, Open, or Fresh  
If the original feels light or fun, offer a version with a warm or cheeky twist.  
If the original is sincere or awkward, offer a version with more personality or vulnerability instead of humor.

Keep all versions short, natural, and conversational. Avoid robotic or overly formal tone.

Return only the 3 rewritten messages, no labels or explanation.
