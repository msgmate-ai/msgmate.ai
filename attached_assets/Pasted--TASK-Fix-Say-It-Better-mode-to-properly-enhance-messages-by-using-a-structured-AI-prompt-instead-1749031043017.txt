// TASK: Fix Say It Better mode to properly enhance messages by using a structured AI prompt instead of passing raw user input directly.

// CONTEXT:
// In say_it_better mode, the AI should enhance the user's own message (userInput), not reply to it.
// The current implementation is still passing raw input as the prompt, which causes the AI to treat it like a reply or echo it directly.

// âœ… INSTRUCTION:

// 1. In your /api/generate-replies route (or wherever the OpenAI API call is handled):
// Check for the logic that handles mode === "say_it_better".

if (mode === "say_it_better") {
  // âœ… STEP 1: Build the full enhancement prompt using userInput
  const aiPrompt = `
You are helping someone improve a message they want to send in a dating conversation.

Hereâ€™s the original message:
"${userInput}"

Please rewrite it to sound more natural, confident, and emotionally in tune â€” while keeping the meaning and vibe of the original.

Keep the message casual and authentic, not overly formal or exaggerated. Make small adjustments to clarity, tone, and flow.

Return 2â€“3 improved versions only.
  `;

  // âœ… STEP 2: Use this prompt in your OpenAI call
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: aiPrompt }],
    temperature: 0.8,
    max_tokens: 250,
  });

  // âœ… STEP 3: (Optional) Log full prompt for verification
  console.log("AI prompt being sent:", aiPrompt);
}

// 2. For all other modes (e.g., tone_reply), keep your existing logic as-is.

// ðŸ§ª TEST CASE:
// userInput: "really feel like I want to bust out of work and come see you"
// Expected output: 2â€“3 rewritten versions like:
//   - "I keep thinking about ditching work just to come see you."
//   - "Wish I could sneak away from work and see you right now."

// ðŸ›‘ DO NOT:
// - Pass userInput directly to OpenAI (e.g., aiPrompt = userInput)
// - Use the reply-style prompt for say_it_better
// - Include messageToReplyTo or selectedTone in say_it_better logic
